                    <p>Created as a replacement for the character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Mickey Mouse was born in 1928. In the earliest known drawings of Mickey and in his first cartoon Plane Crazy, he has a long, rat-like nose, no shoes or gloves, and his eyes take up half of his face.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>During this era, Mickey was more simplistic and less refined. He had black and white coloring, large, oval eyes, a long, pointed nose, and a small body. His ears were always circular, regardless of the angle they were viewed from, which became a distinctive feature.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>By this period, Mickey had evolved to have a more pear-shaped body, pupils in his eyes, and a shorter nose. These changes made him appear friendlier and more approachable. This era also marked the transition from black and white to color animations, adding more depth and vibrancy to his character.</p>

                    <p>Mickey's design became more consistent in these decades, with standardized features in various animations and merchandise. His eyes were more expressive, and his movements and expressions were more fluid and realistic, thanks to advancements in animation technology.</p>

                    <p>In the 2000s, Mickey Mouse received a few updates to modernize his look while retaining his classic features. This included a more three-dimensional appearance in some animations, thanks to computer-generated imagery (CGI). His personality traits and core characteristics remained consistent, preserving his timeless appeal.</p>
