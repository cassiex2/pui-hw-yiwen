                    </div>
                    <p>Goofy was introduced as "Dippy Dawg" and initially had a more elderly look with a white beard, a bald head, and spectacles. His clothes were tattered, emphasizing his clumsy and goofy nature.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>By this time, Goofy had transformed into a younger character, losing the beard and glasses. His trademark tall hat, vest, pants, and shoes became more defined. His ears became longer and his nose more prominent, solidifying his unique dog-like appearance.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>During these decades, Goofy's appearance remained relatively consistent. He was a regular character in comics and television shorts, where his design was simplified and standardized for easier animation. His character became known for his clumsiness and good-natured buffoonery.</p>

                    <p>In the 1980s and 1990s, Goofy's design didn't change significantly. However, he starred in his own television series, "Goof Troop," in the early 1990s. In this series, Goofy was portrayed as a single father, which added depth to his character. His clothing was slightly updated, but his overall look remained consistent with his traditional appearance.</p>

                    <p> In the 2000s, Goofy continued to appear in various media, including the "House of Mouse" and "Mickey Mouse Clubhouse." His design was refined with more modern animation techniques, including computer animation, giving him a smoother, more three-dimensional appearance. Despite these updates, his classic look - tall hat, vest, and distinctively floppy ears - remained largely unchanged.</p>
